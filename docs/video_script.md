Narrator: "Meet Sarah, a young writer who has been keeping a diary since she was 12. Every day, she would write about her adventures, dreams, and the little moments that made her smile. But as life got busier, finding time to write became harder, and her precious memories started slipping away.

One day, while cleaning her room, she found her old diaries covered in dust. As she flipped through the pages, she realized how much she missed documenting her life. That's when she discovered our Diary App - a modern solution that makes journaling as easy as taking a photo."

- Your current location, so you'll always remember where you were
- The weather, captured directly from your device's sensors
- Photos of your surroundings
- A selfie to remember how you looked that day
- Even the song that's playing in the background"

## Behind the Scenes (2:30 - 3:30)

Narrator: "What makes the Diary App so smooth and responsive is its intelligent use of multiple threads, each handling a specific task:

The main thread keeps the interface responsive and handles your interactions, while in the background:
- A storage thread manages all your diary entries and photos
- A metadata thread collects location and weather data
- An export thread handles creating backup bundles
- A logging thread ensures everything runs smoothly

This multi-threaded architecture means you can take photos, write entries, and export your diary without any lag or freezing."
