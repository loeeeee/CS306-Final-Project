# Phase 5 Development Report: Diary Export Functionality

## Overview
This report documents the implementation of Phase 5, which focused on developing the diary export functionality and improving entry management. The implementation includes a robust export system, as well as full support for editing and deleting diary entries, with proper UI updates and data integrity.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Export Architecture
A new module `DiaryExporter` was created to centralize all export-related functionality. This class provides a clean interface for creating export bundles and managing the export process.

**File:** `src/diary_kivy_app/core_logic/diary_exporter.py`

Key features:
- ZIP-based bundle creation
- Comprehensive manifest generation
- Media file packaging
- Error handling and logging
- Timestamp-based export naming
- Individual entry saving functionality
- Directory management

### 2. Entry Editing and Deletion

#### Editing Entries
- The editor screen now supports both creating new entries and editing existing ones.
- When editing, the original entry's `entry_id` and `timestamp_created` are preserved.
- The editor is pre-filled with the selected entry's data when accessed from the view screen.
- On save, the entry is updated in place, and the main screen is refreshed to reflect changes.
- The editor resets its state after saving or canceling.

#### Deleting Entries
- The view screen provides a delete button for each entry.
- On delete, the entry is removed from storage and the main screen is refreshed.
- The delete action is immediate; a confirmation dialog can be added in the future for safety.

### 3. UI Synchronization
- After editing or deleting an entry, the main screen's entry list is automatically refreshed.
- The view and editor screens are visually consistent, with card-like layouts and clear sectioning.
- The user experience is seamless: changes are reflected immediately without requiring a restart or manual refresh.

### 4. Export Bundle Structure
The export bundle is implemented as a ZIP archive with the following structure:
```
diary_export_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.zip
├── manifest.json
├── entries/
│   ├── entry_1.json
│   ├── entry_2.json
│   └── ...
└── media/
    ├── photo_1.jpg
    ├── photo_2.png
    └── ...
```

### 5. Manifest Implementation
The manifest file (`manifest.json`) contains:
- Export metadata (date, version)
- List of all diary entries with their metadata
- List of all media files with their properties
- File organization information

Example manifest structure:
```json
{
    "export_date": "2024-03-20T15:30:00",
    "version": "1.0",
    "entries": [
        {
            "id": "entry_1",
            "created": "2024-03-19T10:00:00",
            "modified": "2024-03-19T10:30:00",
            "file": "entry_1.json"
        }
    ],
    "media_files": [
        {
            "name": "photo_1.jpg",
            "size": 1024000,
            "type": "jpg"
        }
    ]
}
```

### 6. Export Process Implementation
The export process includes:
- Timestamp-based bundle naming
- ZIP file creation with compression
- Manifest generation
- Entry file collection and packaging
- Media file collection and packaging
- Error handling and validation

Implementation details:
```python
def create_export_bundle(self, output_path: str) -> bool:
    try:
        timestamp = datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")
        bundle_path = Path(output_path) / f"diary_export_{timestamp}.zip"
        
        with zipfile.ZipFile(bundle_path, 'w', zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED) as zipf:
            manifest = self._create_manifest()
            zipf.writestr('manifest.json', json.dumps(manifest, indent=2))
            
            # Add entries and media files
            for entry_file in self.entries_dir.glob('*.json'):
                zipf.write(entry_file, f"entries/{entry_file.name}")
            
            for media_file in self.media_dir.glob('*'):
                if media_file.is_file():
                    zipf.write(media_file, f"media/{media_file.name}")
        
        return True
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error creating export bundle: {str(e)}")
        return False
```

### 7. Error Handling
Comprehensive error handling was implemented:
- File access and permission checks
- JSON parsing validation
- ZIP file creation error handling
- Media file validation
- User feedback mechanisms
- Required field validation
- Directory creation error handling
- UTF-8 encoding support
- Data integrity for edits and deletes

### 8. Technical Decisions

   - JSON format for easy parsing
   - Comprehensive metadata tracking
   - Version information for future compatibility

5. **Save & Edit Implementation**
   - JSON-based storage
   - UTF-8 encoding support
   - Required field validation
   - Automatic timestamp tracking
