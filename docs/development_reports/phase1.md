# Development Report - Phase 1: Project Setup & Foundation

This report details the completion of Phase 1 of the multi-platform diary app development, as outlined in `docs/phases.md`.

## 1. Environment Configuration

- Verified Python 3.12 is the intended version as per `docs/goals.md`.
- Installed the Kivy framework and the `plyer` library using `pip` within the `.env/` virtual environment. The command executed was:
  ```bash
  source .env/bin/activate && pip install kivy plyer
  ```
- Confirmed that Python's built-in `os` and `shutil` modules will be used for file system operations.
- Assisted the user in configuring VSCode to use the `.env/` virtual environment's Python interpreter to resolve linter errors related to Kivy imports.

## 2. Project Structure Refinement

- Created a new dedicated directory for the diary application: `src/diary_kivy_app/`.
- Established the following subdirectories within `src/diary_kivy_app/` to organize the project:
    - `ui/`
    - `core_logic/`
    - `utils/`
    - `assets/`
    - `tests/`

The resulting directory structure within `src/` is:

```
src/
├── app_with_story/
└── diary_kivy_app/
    ├── assets/
    ├── core_logic/
    ├── tests/
    ├── ui/
    └── utils/
```

## 3. Version Control (`.gitignore` Update)

- Reviewed the existing `.gitignore` file.
- Added the Kivy-specific pattern `*.kivy.log` to the `.gitignore` file to prevent Kivy log files from being tracked by Git.

## 4. Basic Application Shell

- Created the `src/diary_kivy_app/main.py` file.
- Implemented a minimal Kivy application structure in `main.py` with a basic `App` subclass and a `Label` widget.

The initial content of `src/diary_kivy_app/main.py` is:

```python
from kivy.app import App
from kivy.uix.label import Label

class DiaryApp(App):
    def build(self):
        return Label(text='Hello, Diary App!')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    DiaryApp().run()
```

## Conclusion

Phase 1, focusing on project setup and establishing the foundational environment and structure, is now complete. The necessary libraries are installed within the virtual environment, the project directories are organized, version control is updated for Kivy development, and a basic Kivy application shell is in place. The environment is now ready for the implementation of core functionality in Phase 2.
